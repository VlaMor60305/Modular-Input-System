This is a system of Input Control that allow you to create
almost infinity controllers: all that you need it's: 
- create fields which neccessary to control something in your game
- write a script inherited from InputSetting and setting up values to your fields in Update

In this project I've made 2 examples of controlling: Desktop and Mobile
